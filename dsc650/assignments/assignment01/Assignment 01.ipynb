    "- Let's assume using unicode characters in UTF-8 which would be between 1 and 4 Bytes per character. I'll use the high end, 4 Bytes per character. 128 characters x 4 Bytes = 512 Bytes per tweet. Other estimates I found were an average of 200 Bytes per tweet and 560 Bytes per 140 character tweet. https://stackoverflow.com/questions/5999821/how-many-bytes-of-memory-is-a-tweet/5999852. 512 Bytes per tweet x 500 million tweets per day = 256 billion Bytes / 1024 / 1024 / 1024 = 238.42 GB in size. For HD, multiply by 3 since we are using HDFS, 715.26 GB, which is less than 10 TB.
